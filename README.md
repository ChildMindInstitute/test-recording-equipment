# SM_openSMILE
Scripts to analyze waveform files with openSMILE for the study of selective mutism.

## [`openSMILE_preprocessing`](https://github.com/shnizzedy/SM_openSMILE/tree/master/openSMILE_preprocessing "functions to prepare files for openSMILE analysis")
Functions to prepare files for openSMILE analysis.

These functions were written to determine appropriate masking options for analyzing noise-polluted waveforms in openSMILE.

## [`openSMILE_runSM`](https://github.com/shnizzedy/SM_openSMILE/tree/master/openSMILE_runSM "batch process SM dataset with user-entered openSMILE configuration file")
Batch process SM dataset with user-entered openSMILE configuration file.

Load the contents of this folder into openSMILE home directory.

Run runSM() to run openSMILE config file on all Waveform files with extension `*.wav` in `[openSMILE home directory]/all_audio_files/[URSI]/recorded_audio_files/`.

It will ask for config_file. Just give it the filename. The file should live in `[openSMILE home directory]/config`.
